# Coffee-Shop-Management-with-Python
To make something practical, I decided to create a python coffee shop management application.

This application is able to:
1. Make orders (Also subtracts material from Database)
2. Offers Discounts
3. Able to know if there is enough materials to make coffee
4. And be able to push and pull data from a databse I worked with.
